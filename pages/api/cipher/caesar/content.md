In Caesar cipher, the set of plain text characters is replaced by any other character, symbols or numbers. It is a very weak technique of hiding text. In Caesar’s cipher, each alphabet in the message is replaced by three places down. Let’s see one example. The plain text is EDUCBA. As a Caesar cipher, each alphabet is replaced by three-place down so that E will replace by H, D will replace by G, U will replace by X, C will replace by F, B will replace by E, and A will replace by D. So here the plain text is EDUCBA and ciphertext Is HGXFED.

Caesar cipher algorithm is as follows:

- Read each alphabet of plain text.
- Replace each alphabet with 3 places down.
- Repeat the process for all alphabet in plain text.
  A Modified Version of Caesar Cipher: This cipher works the same as Caesar cipher; the only difference is in Caesar cipher, each alphabet is replaced by three-place down wherein a modified version of Caesar cipher, a user decides the number to replace the alphabet, and this number will be constant. For example, EDUCBA and number for the replacement are 1, so E will replace by F, D will replace by E, U will replace by V, C will replace by D, B will replace by C, and A will replace by B. So here, the plain text is EDUCBA, and ciphertext Is FEVDCB.

A modified version of the Caesar cipher algorithm is as follows.

Read each alphabet of plain text.
Take the number for replacement.
Replace each alphabet with a specified number down.
Repeat the process for all alphabet in plain text.
